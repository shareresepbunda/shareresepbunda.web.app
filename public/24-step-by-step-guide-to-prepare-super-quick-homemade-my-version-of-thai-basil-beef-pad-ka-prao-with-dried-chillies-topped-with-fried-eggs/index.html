<p>While we've posted a recipe for Thai Basil Chicken in the past, this beef version has a more intense flavor that comes from the darker, richer sauce used. Pad Kra Pao means stir-fry basil, thus making it the main ingredient in this classic dish from Thailand. The combination of Thai basil, spicy chillies, pungent fish sauce and chicken make this dish amazingly delicious and appetizing. Serve with hot rice topped with a fried egg.</p>
